I understand you don't want a script just yet. Let me explain the current implementation and what we can do next:

The `DocumentProcessor` class I've created includes all the preprocessing steps you requested:

1. **Brusreducering (Noise Reduction)**: Implemented in `reduce_noise()` using both Gaussian blur and bilateral filtering for optimal noise removal while preserving text edges.

2. **Skevhetskorrigering (Skew Correction)**: Implemented in `correct_skew()` which automatically detects document rotation and corrects it.

3. **Kontrastförbättring (Contrast Enhancement)**: Implemented in `enhance_contrast()` using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) in LAB color space.

4. **Storleksnormalisering (Size Normalization)**: Implemented in `normalize_size()` which scales images to a consistent width while maintaining aspect ratio.

5. **Ljussättningskorrigering (Lighting Correction)**: Implemented in `correct_lighting()` using adaptive histogram equalization.

6. **Kantskärpning (Edge Sharpening)**: Implemented in `sharpen_edges()` using a custom sharpening kernel.

7. **Gråskala (Grayscale Conversion)**: Implemented in `convert_to_grayscale()`.

The class is set up to use EasyOCR with Swedish language support (`['sv']`). Each preprocessing step can be used individually or all at once through the `process_document()` method.



Ah, perfect! Now we have clear distinguishing features for each page. Let me update the `DocumentProcessor` class to use these specific markers for page identification:



I've updated the `DocumentProcessor` class with a new page identification method that uses the specific markers we know about:

1. For Page 1:
   - Title: "Aktivitetsrapport"
   - Page number: "Sida 1(2)"

2. For Page 2:
   - Title: "Har du anmält intresse för ett jobb som inte annonserats?"
   - Page number: "Sida 2(2)"

The new `identify_page()` method:
1. Performs OCR on the image
2. Looks for these specific markers in the detected text
3. Returns the page number based on which markers are found
4. If no exact matches are found, it uses a scoring system to determine the most likely page

This approach is more reliable than template matching because:
1. It uses actual text content rather than image patterns
2. It's more robust to variations in scanning quality
3. It can handle slight rotations or scaling issues
4. It doesn't require template images

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific markers for each page?
2. Add confidence scoring for the page identification?
3. Add visualization of the detected markers?
4. Or would you like to test this implementation first?
